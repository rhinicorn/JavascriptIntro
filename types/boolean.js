//what is a boolean
//they are either true or false


/*
x=5 <-- do not do this
var x=5 <-- don't do this either 
let x=5 <--when you might change the value

const x=5 <--when you want the value to stay the same

*/

//creating a new variable (2-steps)
//Declaration
let y

//Initialization aka variable assignment
y=5

//how can we make booleans
let x =Boolean(5) //function that turns something to a boolean

x=Boolean(0)
console.log(x)


//Truthy  //Falsey
let z= false;  //literal assignment of false Boolean value
console.log (typeof z)

z= true
let result = 5>4

//==  check for equality
//=== check for equality of value and type

// Single ! = bang


let flippedBool = !(true)





//why are they useful
